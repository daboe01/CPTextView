CPTextView
==========
This is an implementation of the cocoa text system for cappuccino.
It is based on the (long-dead) cappuccino-fork from <http://github.com/emaillard/cappuccino>.

I extracted the classes CPTextView, CPTextStorage, CPTextContainer, CPLayoutManager and CPSimpleTypesetter to create a standalone framework. This framework is compatible with the current master of cappuccino.
