CPTextView
==========
This is an implementation of the cocoa text system for cappuccino.
It is based on the (long-dead) cappuccino-fork from <http://github.com/emaillard/cappuccino>.

I extracted and improved/rewrote the classes CPTextView, CPTextStorage, CPTextContainer, CPLayoutManager and CPSimpleTypesetter to create a standalone framework that is usable with the current master of cappuccino.

This repo is obsolete
=====================
Please use the version from cappuccino
